# SvalMap
A simple package to plot shapefiles of svalbard taken from the NP S100 data.

You'll need the 'S100 Kartdata' shapefiles from the Norwegian Polar Institute to run this script (they're too large for this repository).

Get them here:

[https://geodata.npolar.no/](https://geodata.npolar.no/)

and put them in a folder called ./data/NP_S100_SHP/[files].
